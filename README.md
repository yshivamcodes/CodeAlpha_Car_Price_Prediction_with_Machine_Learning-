#  Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using supervised machine learning algorithms. It leverages key features such as the year of purchase, present price, fuel type, kilometers driven, and more to estimate a car's resale value.

##  Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled categorical and numerical data, removed outliers, and performed feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized distributions, correlations, and feature importance.
- **Model Building**: Implemented regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Used R² Score, MAE, and MSE for model validation.
